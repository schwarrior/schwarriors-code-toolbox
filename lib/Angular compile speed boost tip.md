Tip: Boost Angular Compile Speed
================================

Angular development on Windows is sluggish. 

The speed of Angular compilation via `ng serve` or `ng build` commands can be increased dramatically by disabling Windows Real-Time virus protection. 

To disable real-time scanning on Windows 11:

1. Open Windows Security app
2. Go to Virus & thread protection tab
3. Under Virus and threat protection settings heading, click the Manage Settings link.
4. Under Real-time protection heading, toggle switch to Off.
