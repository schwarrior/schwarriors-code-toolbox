# Welcome to Schwarrior's Code Toolbox

A library of reusable solutions for software development.

## Overview

This is a library of code snippets in a variety of languages.

Over the last 25 years working as a software developer and a DBA, I found myself returning to the patterns and solutions in this toolbox again and again.

The sample code files that comprise the library can be found in the [lib folder](https://github.com/schwarrior/schwarriors-code-toolbox/tree/main/lib).

There are also utility scripts used for mantaining the library. See the [util folder](https://github.com/schwarrior/schwarriors-code-toolbox/tree/main/util) folder.

## Development Roadmap

1) Experiment with the GitHub repo search functionality. Will it recognize and index meta-information and tags inside of the code commentary? Does it work for all the major file types in the toolbox?
2) Develop a utility that will create a code comment flowerbox at the top of each file. For C# an VB code files, the flowerbox could be in the .NET XML documentation format.Populate the flowerbox with keywords that currently bloat the lib file names. Add additional tags indicating the target computer language and platform (for example: Language: C#. Platform: LinqPad).
3) Rename all the of lib files. Now freed of needing the file name to be an index of all relevant patterns and technologies, use shorter and simpler names that focus on describing the software feature that the code could be used to develop.
3) Find others who have created similiar projects. Discover how to grow this library from personal use into something that can benifit lots of developers around the world.
4) Consult with someone who has studied library science and computer science. What organizational systems would allow the toolbox to become much bigger without becoming bloated, unwieldy and outdated ? 

## File Tagging

Add the following tags, in comment (as defined for file type) to top of file
- meta-language: C#, VB.Net, JavaScript
- meta-platform: LinqPad, Angular, WinForms
- meta-pattern (optional tag): factory, mvc 
- meta-keyworks: using, dispose, garbage collection
